 **GUN AND BACKGROUND CHECK**

## Background:

Guns control is a very sensitive issue in America and had been throughout our history. The depate been going on for years about changing the Sencond

Ammendment and introducing more strict gun laws. In this project we look at guns laws and how effective they are in lowering gun relarted crimes.

We also look at the idea that stricter gun laws reduces guns deaths.

We used the states of Texas and California as a case study for two reasons:

 1- They are the most populous states in America.

 2- California is an obliged (applicants will be granted license as long as they meet extensive requirements). While Texas is a non obliged state 
(applicants will be granted license as long as they meet basic requirements) [Learn More](https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/policy-areas/background-checks/universal-background-checks/).

Description/Outline: THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BACKGROUND CHECKS ACROSS STATES WITH OBLIGED AND NON OBLIGED BACKGROUND REQUIREMENT IN RELATION TO CRIME RATES DUE TO GUN DEATHS

### Research Questions:
 
   * What are the number of applicants that were approved or denied on background checks for Texas and California from 2013-2018?
   
   * What are the number of firearm purchases in Texas and California from 2013-2018?
   
   * What are the firearm related crime rates in Texas and California from 2013-2018?
   
   * What do the background checks, firearm purchases, and firearm related crime rates look like from 2013-2018?
   
   * Sources for datasets we used: [gunpolicy](https://www.gunpolicy.org/api), [bjs](https://www.bjs.gov/developer/ncvs/index.cfm) and [BuzzFeedNews](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks/tree/master/data).
   
### Tasks Breakdown:
   
   * Parse background check data to retrieve approvals and denials for Texas and California from 2013-2018, store in a table, and plot a line graph for each state      showing the time frame, approvals, and denials.
   
   * Parse firearm purchase data to retrieve total firearms sold in Texas and California from 2013-2018, store in a table, and plot each state’s result in a line      graph.
   
   * Parse firearm related crime rates in Texas and California from 2013-2018, store in a table, and plot each state’s result in a line graph.
   
   * Determine if there is a correlation between background checks and firearm related crimes by creating a scatter plots of Texas and California showing background    checks and firearm related crime rates.
   
   * Make graphs for each task.

## Analysis:

**First**

We looked at gun ralated deaths for each state.

![CA vs TX gun ralated death](images/Ca-vs-Tx/cal_vs_Tex_Death.png)

As you can see from the above chart: General trend is that Texas gun related deaths is going up study while California is going down, however,

through out the course of this studey time from 1999-2018, California numbers are very much the same in 1999 and 2018. indeed Texas have more gun

related deaths in 2018 than California, but over time California numbers did not improve much. this become more obvious with next analogy.

**Second**

We looked at state total number of guns laws vs gun ralated death for the same period of time.
 
### Texas:

#### <a id="TX-gun-laws-vs-death"></a>TX Guns Laws vs Guns Related Deaths
![TX-gun-laws-vs-death](images/Texas/tex_gun_deaths.png)

Overtime the state did not introduce alot of laws, only five new laws from 1999 to 2018. Once again, the number of gun related death is going up
in an study pace. 

### California:

#### <a id="CA-gun-laws-vs-death"></a>CA Guns Laws vs Guns Related Deaths
![CA-gun-laws-vs-death](images/California/cal_gun_deaths.png)

For Calfornia, they  introduced 35 new laws for the same period and the number of deaths is going up and down, however the change is not that much
from 1999 to 2018.

**Third**

We looked at mass shooting in both states:

#### <a id="TX-vs-CA-mass-shooting"></a>TX vs CA Mass Shooting

The numbers are not study, however over all, Texas number are going up and California's are going down.

## Conclusion

Overall our study indicate that increasing guns laws slightly correlate with decreasing gun related deaths. 

Further study need to be done. use Texas and California as sample population and run statistic analysis to determine if 

thay represent the ramaining U.S.A populations.

As stated early, gun laws and second ammendment are very controversial issues and very political at the same time. Many arguments can be made

in both side of the isle, however everyone seems to agree on one thing:"We Need to Stop the Violence Across the Country".
